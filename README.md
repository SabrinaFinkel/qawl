As salāmu ´alaykum dear sisters and brothers,

There are dozens of amazing Qur'ān applications on mobile devices, and some great ones online for all devices (like the awesome quran.com) — but there was nothing up-to-date that targeted desktop computers/laptops.

Al-Kitāb is an uncompromising desktop Qur'ān reading app, featuring:

* Ultra high quality images of the Medina Mushaf

* Precise, user-controlled zoom settings

* Go to any page of the Qur'ān by selecting a surah, "turning" the page, or directly typing in your page of choice

* Do the above using keyboard shortcuts! Simply start typing your page and then press enter to go there, and then use the left/right arrow keys to flip pages quickly

* Simple and focused

* Longevity — this is an open-source project, so all of you are invited to give feedback, report bugs, and/or develop improvements

## Install
Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/mr-islam/al-kitab/releases).

Alternatively, try out a limited version of [al-Kitāb, online](https://mr-islam.github.io/al-kitab/) — with a lower quality mushaf for faster loading. This is just so you can give it a try; the real experience is on the desktop app!

## Dev
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` to the directory and run `yarn` to install (dev) dependencies

## To-do

- animations upon page change

- zoom keyboard shortcut
